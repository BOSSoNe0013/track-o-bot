## GNU/Linux

* Create folder .Hearthstone in your home directory
* Create symlinks of the Hearthstone's output_log and log.config in the newly created folder

# Build Instructions

```
qmake
make
```

(Use ``nmake`` instead of ``make`` on Windows)

On Linux, you might have to do the following if you have qt5 installed

```
qmake QT+=widgets
make
```

The resulting binary can be found in the ``build`` subfolder.

# Install Instructions

```
sudo make install
```

Default install prefix is /usr/local. You can change it by adding PREFIX argument to qmake-qt4 command eg:

```
qmake QT+=widgets PREFIX=/usr
```
